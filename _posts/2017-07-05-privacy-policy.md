# **Privacy Policy**

Your satisfaction is our long-term pursuit and concern. We want you to shop with confidence. That's why we provide guarantees that ensure you'll receive your item on time and as described.

Everyone who shops on our SOSTOOL.HELP store receives the following guarantees:

Full Refund if you don't receive your order. If your order does not arrive within the delivery time promised by our SOSTOOL.HELP Rules. (PLEASE wait all your maximum approximate shipping time, see our [shipping terms][0].)

Full or Partial Refund if the item is not as described. If your item is significantly different from the product description, you can A: Return it and get a full refund, or B: Get a partial refund and keep the item.

_**Full refunds are not available under the following circumstances**_:

1. Your order did not arrive due to factors within your control (i.e. providing the wrong shipping address)
2. Your order did not arrive due to exceptional circumstances outside the control of our SOSTOOL.HELP Rules (i.e. not cleared by customs, delayed by a natural disaster).
3. You didn't sent us clear pictures or video proof of product not as describe.

You can submit refund requests by sending us a message.

# **Refunds & Returns Policy**

### Order cancellation

All orders can be cancelled until they are shipped. If your order has been paid and you need to make a change or cancel an order, you must contact us within 12 hours. Once the packaging and shipping process has started, it can no longer be cancelled.

### Refunds

Your satisfaction is our \#1 priority. Therefore,

If you did **not** receive the product within the guaranteed time (45 days not including 2-5 day processing) you can request a refund or a reshipment. If you received the wrong item you can request a refund or a reshipment. If you do not want the product you've receive you may request a refund but you must return the item at your expense and the item must be unused.

* Your order did not arrive due to factors within your control (i.e. providing the wrong shipping address)
* Your order did not arrive due to exceptional circumstances outside the control of SOSTOOL.HELP (i.e. not cleared by customs, delayed by a natural disaster).

\*You can submit refund requests **within 7 days** after the guaranteed period for delivery (max. 45 days) has expired. You can do it by sending a message.

If you are approved for a refund, then your refund will be processed, and a credit will automatically be applied to your credit card or original method of payment, within 14 days.

Please do not send your purchase back to us unless we authorize you to do so.

Thanks
